### Description: 

Writing a program which, given two numbers of two hypothetical players, generates a random number between 1 and 100 (zero excluded).</br>
The next step is to check whether one of the two players has guessed the random number, and if not which of the two has come closest to the number.

Example:
Input:
Player 1 = 5,
Player 2 = 10

Output: 
Random number generated = 7

Result:
"Neither of them guessed the random number, but player 1 came closest!"

### Terminal:
- npm i --save-dev @types/node
- npm i --save-dev @types/jquery                           
- tsc --init

tsc nomefile.ts
